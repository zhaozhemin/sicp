I did about 55% of the exercises. It's not enough. Maybe someday I
will revisit them. In the evaluators directory are, you guessed it,
evaluators produced along the way of reading the book. Those
'textbook' ones are pretty much copy-pastes from the book; those
'exercise' have changes required by the exercises. All of them are
probably running fine with Racket. Maybe you will find some of these
useful, who knows. Have fun.
